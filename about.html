                    <h2> About the Artist: </h2>
                    <p> I'm Faivana / Faida, a digital artist inspired by anime and manga. Ibis PAint was my first ever drawing program then later on I made the switch to Procreate. But my first medium was traditional pencil and eraser. I first picked up the pencil when I was a kid with a big imagination. I started to seriously draw as I got older while figuring out what my dreams and goals are for the future. Now, I've gained a small following of people who stick around to enjoy my art!

                    <p> If you're interested in more content, I also make youtube videos of my art process and new content will be released soon. </p>
